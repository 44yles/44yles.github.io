# Welcome.

I'm Myles. Please, enjoy your stay here. I like to write about programming,
math and statistics, with a reasonable dose of running and cooking as well. I'm
known on Twitter as [@44yles](https://twitter.com/44yles) and have some limited
open source work available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/44yles).

I have a BS in Aerospace Engineering and I currently work in fintech as an
engineer. Outside of my profession, which has quite a few overlaps into my
hobby territory, I enjoy running and cooking. I live with my wife and children
in Chicago, USA.
