<p>I'm Myles. Please, enjoy your stay here. I like to write about programming,
math and statistics, with a reasonable dose of running and cooking as well. I'm
known on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/44yles">@44yles</a> and have some limited
open source work available on <a href="https://github.com/44yles">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>I have a BS in Aerospace Engineering and I currently work in fintech as an
engineer. Outside of my profession, which has quite a few overlaps into my
hobby territory, I enjoy running and cooking. I live with my wife and children
in Chicago, USA.</p>
